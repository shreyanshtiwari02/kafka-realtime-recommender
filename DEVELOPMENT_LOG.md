# Real-Time Recommendation System Development Log

## Project Overview
Building a recommendation system that adapts to user behavior in real-time using Kafka components.

### Key Components:
- Kafka Streams for feature extraction
- Integration with ML frameworks
- Feedback loops for model improvement

### Features:
- Real-time user behavior analysis
- A/B testing framework
- Model performance monitoring

## Development Steps

### Phase 1: Project Initialization (2025-03-14)
- Created project directory: `kafka-realtime-recommender`
- Initialized Git repository
- Set up this development log for tracking progress

### Phase 2: Spring Boot Project Setup (2025-03-14)
- Created Maven project structure
- Added Spring Boot dependencies in `pom.xml`:
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Kafka
  - Spring Actuator
  - Lombok
  - Spring DevTools
  - Kafka Streams
  - DeepLearning4J for ML integration
- Created main application class with `@EnableKafka` and `@EnableKafkaStreams` annotations
- Configured Kafka properties in `application.properties`

### Phase 3: Domain Model and Kafka Configuration (2025-03-14)
- Created model classes:
  - `UserEvent`: Represents user interactions (views, clicks, purchases, etc.)
  - `Item`: Represents items that can be recommended
  - `UserProfile`: Contains user preferences and interaction history
  - `Recommendation`: Represents recommendations generated for users
- Set up Kafka configuration:
  - Defined Kafka topics for user events, profiles, recommendations, etc.
  - Configured Kafka Streams for real-time processing
  - Set up topic partitioning and replication
